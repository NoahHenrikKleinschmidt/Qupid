A web-based GUI for the <a href = "https://github.com/NoahHenrikKleinschmidt/qpcr.git">qpcr package</a> that allows easy, simple and high-throughput analysis of qPCR data. As is described in more detail in the <a href = "https://github.com/NoahHenrikKleinschmidt/qpcr.git">repo</a> of the source package _qpcr_ this app is designed to work with datasets that contain a two-column architecture of sample_name, CT-value. It will enable in a very intuitive interface both single Delta-Ct and Delta-Delta-Ct analyses of one or multiple input datasets.

## Now directly available as web-app: <a href = "https://share.streamlit.io/noahhenrikkleinschmidt/qpcr-analyser/main/main.py"> qPCR Analysis Tool </a>
